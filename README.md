# pyOpenScience Governance

## What is pyOpenScience?

The pyOpenScience project draws inspiration from [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), a
community to help promote, teach, and grow best-practices in software development for the
Scientific R stack.

pyOpenScience is currently trying to determine a plan and scope to begin adopting the same
principles for Scientific Python. We'd love to hear your input and thoughts about how this
project can be most-useful for the Python community.

## Roadmap

The following document lays out our (vague) roadmap for what we'll work on next. It's currently
at the following HackMD link:

## Meetings

The pyOpenScience community meets roughly every 3 weeks. This is a place to collect
links to the notes from those meetings.

## Scope

The following is a rough scope for where pyOpenScience will develop in the coming months.
It is subject to change, and input/feedback is welcome!

Currently, the pyOpenScience scoping document can be found as a Google Doc at this link:
